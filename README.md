## Description
Galicia: North-West of Spain (just on top of Portugal).

The aim of this project is to get a look over the tourism of this region pre and post Covid-19.

For that I am going to check the travellers, nights, average stay, zones, types of accommodation and travellers' origin and compare this data throught the months and years since 2001 to 2022.

I presented some hypothesis around the idea of the tourism regeneration after 2020 and I can confirm that the data shows that tourism in Galicia has indeed increased.
